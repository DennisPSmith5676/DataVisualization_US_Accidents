### Content 

Team members have drafted their project, including the following: 

✓ Selected topic: The U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released its 2021 annual traffic crash data, showing that 38,824 lives were lost in traffic crashes nationwide. That number marks the highest number of fatalities since 2007. Our team got interested in studying and analysing about this data.

✓ Reason why they selected their topic: All of the USA heavily rely on car or some form of road transportation every day. Apart from pandemic time, our major part of the day is spend on commute in onr form or other. So road safety, accidents are the issues close to our heart. Hence our team decided to analyse and get insight from the data avaliable from government agencies on road accidents in the USA.

✓ Description of their source of data: While searching for data, we came across https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset. This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021 for the Contiguous United States.

✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data: US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents. Our team is planning to find the answers to questions such as:
- Which City in US has reported most no. of Accident Cases in last 5 years (2016-2020) ?
- Which are the top 10 accident prone streets in US ?
- Per Day averagely how many road accidents took place in US ?
- In which hours of the day most accidents happened in US ?
- How are the basic weather conditions in most of the accident cases in US ?
- Which are the top 10 States with most no. of road accident cases in US ? ...and More
