In the stage#1 of this project 

Selcted random 50000 rows of mockdataset and has been uploaded database named "Final Project". Then used thst dataset for this machine learning model.

Objectives
The main objective of this machine learning part of this project is to identify factors affecting the accident severity. 
Temm is developing a model that can accurately predict accident severity. 



Process
Performed data cleaning and drop non-benificial columns null values. Extract the Year,Month and Day columns by using Start time column 

Converte the string values into numerical using label encoder.
Split the Data into Training and Testing

Outputs label(target) for our input datset will be "Severity" column.
